**In this article, we'll show how to use OpenAPI Generator to automatically generate Angular HTTP services from your OpenAPI spec.**

<hr>

## Why you need a code generator for your Angular API clients

Every Angular project that talks to a backend faces the same repetitive pain: writing boilerplate code to interact with REST endpoints. 
HTTP clients, models, DTOs, error handling, and keeping everything in sync when the API changes - it adds up fast and slows teams down.

Wouldn't it be great if all of that could be automated?

That's exactly what **API code generators** do. 
They take your OpenAPI specification and generate fully-typed, ready-to-use client code: consistently, reliably, and within seconds. 
No more hand-written HTTP services. 
No more copy-pasting types. 
No more drift between frontend and backend.

A few years ago, I wrote a popular article on [using Swagger Codegen to generate Angular clients](/blog/2018-04-swagger-codegen). 
Since then, the ecosystem has moved forward: **OpenAPI Generator** emerged as the actively maintained, community-driven successor to Swagger Codegen. 
It's more powerful, better supported, and trusted by companies and open-source projects around the world.

> üëâ In this updated article, I'll show you how easy it is to generate a complete API client for Angular using OpenAPI Generator - and how to integrate it seamlessly into your Angular project.

**Let's get started! üöÄ**


## What you need

- A valid OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.x spec file (JSON/YAML) that describes your REST backend.
- Java 11+ installed, or Docker installed (if installing Java directly is not an option)


## Installation: Use the CLI wrapper for consistent builds

Theoretically, you could download the latest version of the code generator manually: 
just grab the `openapi-generator-cli.jar` from [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/).

But in practice, I **highly recommend** using the official Node.js-based CLI wrapper instead.


```bash
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli --save-dev
```

This small package gives you a simple command-line tool: `openapi-generator-cli`.
Once installed, you can execute it via `npx openapi-generator-cli`.
It gives you the look and feel of all the other Node.js-based tooling that you are already used to.

But more importantly, it installs a **specific version** of the generator and writes that information into the file `openapitools.json` inside your project.

Now, when you check your project into Git (including the file `openapitools.json`), your teammates (or the CI pipeline) will automatically use **the exact same version** when they run the CLI.


- This ensures **100% reproducible code generation** across your entire team.
- No "works on my machine" issues due to different generator versions.
- No unexpected diffs caused by subtle changes in templates or behavior.

That's exactly what we want for a clean and reliable workflow.

### Switching Code Generator Versions

Let's say you want to lock your project to version `7.13.0`. 
You can do this by running:

```bash
npx openapi-generator-cli version-manager set 7.13.0
```

This will:

1. Download the `openapi-generator-cli-7.13.0.jar` file into your `node_modules` folder ‚Äì so it shouldn't be under version control, since typically the local NPM files are never checked in.
2. Record the version into the `openapitools.json` file.

To verify which version is currently active, run:

```bash
npx openapi-generator-cli version
```

This ensures that every team member uses exactly the same code generator version, even if newer versions are released later.
You can also use this mechanism to test new versions or roll back safely.






## Let's Generate Our First Angular API Client

Before we take a look at the code, take a moment to explore [https://api6.angular-buch.com/](api6.angular-buch.com).

This public REST API is part of the **BookMonkey 6** demo application, the updated companion project for the upcoming **5th edition** of our German-language Angular book.


> üìò Save the date!
> The new edition is scheduled for **early 2026**.
> Follow us on [angular.schule](https://www.angular.schule/) and our social media channels for updates!

To explore the API definition, simply open:

‚Üí [OpenAPI Spec Viewer (Swagger UI)](https://api6.angular-buch.com/swagger-ui/)

This graphical interface is fully generated from the OpenAPI specification, located at:

‚Üí `https://api6.angular-buch.com/openapi.json`

If this metadata is rich enough to render a complete admin UI, then it's clearly powerful enough to generate a fully functional Angular API client.
Let's do that now!

### Generate an Angular Client in One Line

We start with the most minimal setup:

```bash
npx openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i https://api6.angular-buch.com/openapi.json \
  -g typescript-angular \
  -o ./src/app/shared/book-monkey-api
```

**Hint:** üí° On Windows (Command Prompt), remove the backslashes and write the command in a single line.


Let's break this down:

| Parameter                   | Meaning                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx openapi-generator-cli` | Runs the OpenAPI Generator CLI (no global install needed) |
| `generate`                  | The command to run: generate code                         |
| `-i`                        | The URL or file path to the OpenAPI specification         |
| `-g`                        | The generator to use (here: `typescript-angular`)         |
| `-o`                        | The output directory for the generated code               |

These are the bare minimum arguments required.
With this, you'll get:

- Typed Angular services for each REST resource
- A full NgModule (`ApiModule`)
- Models for all schemas (e.g. `book`, `author`, etc...)
- `HttpClient`-based methods for every endpoint

> üõ†Ô∏è Pro Tip: Place the output directory somewhere inside your app's structure, but outside of actual components or routing. We suggest a path like `src/app/shared/book-monkey-api/`.


The CLI supports many more options.
To see all available configuration options for the `typescript-angular` generator, use the following command.
This gives you a full list of tweakable settings ‚Äì from service naming patterns to enum handling and many more.

```bash
npx openapi-generator-cli config-help -g typescript-angular

<!--
The following table contains the formatted output of the help command.
Each option can be passed via `--additional-properties=...` or configured via an external config file (e.g. `openapitools.json`).

In the next section, we'll explore how to build and integrate this code into your Angular project.


## Set Up the Generated Code

To integrate the generated API client into your Angular application, you have to register the client using `provideApi()` inside your `app.config.ts`. 

This setup is fully compatible with Angular's standalone application structure:

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { provideApi } from './shared/book-monkey-api';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    // [...]
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideApi()
  ]
};
```

Don't forget to include `provideHttpClient()` to register Angular's `HttpClient` for injection.
This is required, because the generated client uses `HttpClient` internally for every request.

> **IMPORTANT:** The `provideApi()` function is currently available only in the latest snapshot builds of OpenAPI Generator. 
  It will become officially available with version **7.14.0**.

### Custom Base Path

If your API lives under a different domain or base path, you can pass a custom string.
This is very helpful if you have different domains or paths for different development stages.

```ts
provideApi('https://api6.angular-buch.com')

### Full Configuration

You can also pass a full configuration object to set credentials or headers:

```ts
provideApi({
  withCredentials: true,
  username: 'admin',
  password: 'secret'
})
```

### Dynamic Configuration (via Factory)

For dynamic configuration (e.g. based on an injected service), use Angular's `useFactory` syntax:

```ts
import { provideApi, Configuration } from './shared/book-monkey-api';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
    {
      provide: Configuration,
      useFactory: () => {
        const authService = inject(AuthService);
        return new Configuration({
          basePath: 'https://api6.angular-buch.com',
          username: authService.getUsername(),
          password: authService.getPassword()
        };
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

In this example, `AuthService` is a custom service that you need to implement yourself. 
It provides dynamic values like username and password (or tokens) at runtime.
You can tailor it to your authentication needs‚Äîfor example, to return credentials from local storage or a login flow.

Alternatively, you can skip the configuration options entirely and use Angular HTTP interceptors to inject headers or handle authentication globally.
However, that approach is outside the scope of this article.

### Legacy Fallback: Still Using AppModule?

If you haven't migrated to standalone yet, you can still use the `ApiModule` approach:

```ts
import { ApiModule } from './shared/book-monkey-api';

@NgModule({
  imports: [ApiModule.forRoot(() => new Configuration())]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

That said, we highly recommend switching to `provideApi()` for all modern Angular projects.


### Using the stable API until the next release

If you feel uncomfortable relying on a snapshot version, you can use the current stable API until version `7.14.0` is released:

```ts
importProvidersFrom(
  ApiModule.forRoot(() =>
    new Configuration({
      basePath: 'https://api6.angular-buch.com' 
    })
  )
)
```

This approach works reliably and only requires a one-time configuration in your `app.config.ts`.
It can easily be replaced later on by `provideApi()`.


## Integrating the generated service in your component

Once the API client is generated and configured, you can directly inject and use the provided services.
Here's a minimal example:

```ts
import { JsonPipe } from '@angular/common';
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { toSignal } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';

import { BooksService } from './shared/book-monkey-api';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [JsonPipe],
  template: `<pre>{{ books() | json }}</pre>`
})
export class App {

  #booksService = inject(BooksService);
  readonly books = toSignal(this.#booksService.booksGet())
}
```

This works out of the box because our prepared OpenAPI spec defines a `tag` named `books`.
The code generator automatically creates a `BooksService` for that group of endpoints.
A well-crafted and thoughtfully named OpenAPI spec is worth the effort: 
The more care you put into naming resources, operations, and tags, the better the generated service and method names will be. 
This investment pays off with clean, predictable, and developer-friendly TypeScript code that feels natural to use throughout your application.

In addition to services, the generator also provides all related models with full TypeScript typing.
In this example, the method `booksGet()` returns an `Observable<Book[]>`, using the interface `Book` that was also generated.

To fit modern Angular best practices, we use `toSignal()` to turn the Observable into a signal.
This modern pattern keeps your components fully reactive and simplifies state handling without a manual `subscribe()` call or the `async` pipe.


## Modern Data Loading with `rxResource()`

Angular 19 introduced a new reactive primitive: `rxResource()` (still marked as *experimental* as of Angular 20).
It's designed to simplify the way we work with asynchronous data streams - especially when fetching data from APIs.

Instead of manual subscription handling or conversion to signals (via `toSignal()` for example), `rxResource()` wraps our observable-based data source into a signal-friendly API.
It automatically manages loading states, errors, and the latest value.
All this state is exposed as dedicated reactive signals.

This makes it a perfect companion for services generated with OpenAPI Generator.
Here's how we can use the generated `BooksService` together with the new `rxResource()`:

```ts
import { JsonPipe } from '@angular/common';
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { rxResource } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';

import { BooksService } from './shared/book-monkey-api';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [JsonPipe],
  template: `<pre>{{ booksResource.value() | json }}</pre>`
})
export class App {

  #booksService = inject(BooksService);

  readonly booksResource = rxResource({
    stream: () => this.#booksService.booksGet()
  });
}
```

The `rxResource()` primitive comes with several useful properties, all of which are Signals:

* **`value()`**: Returns the current data (or `undefined` if not yet available).
* **`isLoading()`**: Returns `true` while the request is in-flight.
* **`error()`**: Contains an `Error` object if the call failed, otherwise `null`.

This makes it very easy to build reactive apps:

```html
@if (booksResource.error()) {
  <p>‚ùå Failed to load books.</p>
}
@else if (booksResource.isLoading()) {
  <p>‚è≥ Loading books...</p>
}
@else {
  <pre>{{ booksResource.value() | json }}</pre>
}
```

This pattern results in highly declarative and clean code, perfectly aligned with Angular's new Signal-based approach.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! üéâ

You can now generate fully-typed Angular API clients with ease.
Ready to drop into any modern application.
No more manual wiring of HTTP calls. 
No more syncing models by hand. 
No more guesswork.

You've seen how to:

* install and lock the OpenAPI Generator for consistent output
* generate TypeScript code directly from your OpenAPI spec,
* set up the application using the new `provideApi()` syntax,
* and consume your API with powerful Angular features like `toSignal()` and `rxResource()`.

With this setup, your API becomes a living contract, which automatically produces the client-side code you need.

Now go build something awesome. üöÄ
