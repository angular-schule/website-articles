AI agents work directly in your project – they read code, write files, run tests and autonomously plan next steps. You set the direction, the agent executes.</p>\n<p>AI found its way into everyday life through browser-based chats like ChatGPT, Gemini or Perplexity. But anyone developing software with them quickly hits limitations: The chat doesn&#39;t know the project, and code must be manually copied back and forth. AI agents solve this problem. They can essentially do anything we could do on a computer. The agents typically run in a sandbox and ask for confirmation before critical actions.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"%%MARKDOWN_BASE_URL%%/blog/2026-02-agentic-coding/confirmation-dialog.png\" alt=\"Terminal output from Claude Code: A diff shows planned changes to the file app.ts – red lines will be removed, green ones added. Below is the confirmation prompt with the options Yes, Yes allow all edits, Type here to tell Claude what to do differently, and Esc to cancel.\" title=\"Claude Code asks for confirmation before modifying a file.\"><figcaption>Claude Code asks for confirmation before modifying a file.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Angular provides special support for working with such agents, so that we get optimal results and the generated code follows current best practices.\nBefore we go into detail, however, we should discuss why this support is even necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenge-outdated-knowledge\">Challenge: Outdated Knowledge</h2>\n<p>The technical foundation of all AI agents is an LLM (Large Language Model).\nIt is based on training data that was created at a specific point in time.\nSince such training is extremely resource-intensive, it is not performed continuously.\nSo there is practically a cutoff date, and even the best models can only &quot;know&quot; what existed up to that date.</p>\n<p>This becomes problematic with fast-moving technologies like Angular: New features are added and best practices change.\nRecent innovations like Signal Forms, the Resource API or Angular Aria may not be present in the training data.\nOlder concepts like the module system (<code>NgModule</code>) or the structural directives (<code>NgIf</code> and <code>NgFor</code>) are, however, well known to the model.\nConsidering also that older concepts have accumulated more documentation, tutorials and code examples over the years, it is statistically more likely that the model will suggest these.\nFor maintaining existing legacy projects, this is an advantage.\nBut if you aim for a modern application with current best practices, the model is more likely to provide older solutions.\nIn the worst case, the model mixes old and new concepts or <strong>hallucinates</strong>, i.e. it generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect statements.\nThe result is inconsistent or non-functional code.</p>\n<p>The solution lies in providing the AI agent with the necessary context.\nAngular offers two tools for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Configuration files</strong> for instructions and examples</li>\n<li><strong>MCP server</strong> for Angular-specific information (and tools)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ai-configuration-files\">AI Configuration Files</h2>\n<p>At the start of their work, AI agents need as much good information as possible.\nThis is also referred to as context.\nThe vendor has already provided basic rules and instructions, the so-called <strong>System Prompt</strong>.\nBut this is usually not enough: The agent has no knowledge yet about the specific project for which it should perform work.</p>\n<p>This is where project-specific configuration files come into play.\nMost AI agents look for such files with a specific name: Claude Code expects <code>.claude/CLAUDE.md</code>, Cursor uses <code>.cursorrules</code>, GitHub Copilot uses <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> and so on.\nEach vendor has their own standard, but the generic filename <code>AGENTS.md</code> could establish itself as a cross-vendor standard.\nThese files contain a collection of rules and best practices for the respective project.\nThis is called a <strong>Custom Prompt</strong>: a file with project-specific instructions that controls the behavior of the AI agent and supplements the System Prompt.\nYou could also enter these inputs manually before each conversation, but that would be tedious and easy to forget.</p>\n<p>Since no unified standard for the filename has been established yet, the Angular CLI supports various variants.\nIt asks which agent is being used when creating an application and generates the appropriate files.\nWe can also specify the configuration directly with the <code>--ai-config</code> option:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ng <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> my-app <span class=\"hljs-comment\">--ai-config=agents</span>\n</code></pre><p>If we initially decided against an explicit configuration or want to add another one, we can generate such a configuration afterwards:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ng g ai-config\n</code></pre><p>The guidelines include best practices for TypeScript and Angular, specifications for components, state management, templates and services, as well as accessibility requirements.</p>\n<p>The agent now has instructions.\nBut whether it can implement them correctly depends on its knowledge level.\nThe Custom Prompt states, for example, that the new syntax for control flow should be used.\nBut how should the model know how this works if it didn&#39;t exist at the time of training?</p>\n<p>Here we can partially help: The file generated by Angular is a good starting point, but we can extend it.\nUseful are concrete examples for new syntax, project-specific conventions or hints about errors the agent has repeatedly made.\nFor the Custom Prompt: keep it short and focused.\nToo many instructions dilute the effect.\nThe AI agent can actually help formulate good instructions itself.\nThe MCP server, which we will introduce later, can also provide missing information.</p>\n<p>However, there is a limitation: Every LLM can only process a limited amount of text at once.\nThis is called a context window.\nThe Custom Prompt sits in this window, and during longer sessions the instructions can be forgotten.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenge-the-context-window\">Challenge: The Context Window</h2>\n<p><figure><img src=\"%%MARKDOWN_BASE_URL%%/blog/2026-02-agentic-coding/context-command.png\" alt=\"Terminal output of the /context command in Claude Code: The context display shows 127k of 200k tokens (63% utilization). Broken down by System Prompt, System Tools, Memory Files, Skills, Messages and Free Space.\" title=\"Claude Code: The /context command shows the current utilization of the context window.\"><figcaption>Claude Code: The /context command shows the current utilization of the context window.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>When the context window is exceeded, the AI agent &quot;forgets&quot; earlier parts of the conversation.\nThis forgetting is technically necessary for the conversation to continue.\nThe most common approach is to summarize the previous conversation as best as possible (<strong>Context Summarization</strong>).\nThis works wonderfully sometimes and unfortunately not at all other times.\nIf the summary has removed important aspects, this leads to inconsistent responses or outdated code suggestions.</p>\n<p>Related to this is the <strong>Lost-in-the-Middle</strong> effect: Information in the middle of a very long context is given less weight by the model than information at the beginning or end.\nThis can cause initial instructions from Custom Prompts to be neglected as the conversation progresses, and the model falls back only to the original System Prompt.\nThe longer the session lasts, the more likely such effects become.\nModern AI agents use additional strategies beyond summarization, e.g. targeted tool calls or sub-agents with their own context window.\nA particularly elegant solution is offered by the Angular CLI&#39;s MCP server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"angulars-mcp-server\">Angular&#39;s MCP Server</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</a> is an open standard that enables connections between AI applications and external systems.\nMCP servers can provide resources (data sources), tools (callable functions) and prompts (predefined instructions).\nThe Angular team is very active in this new field and provides an integrated MCP server through the Angular CLI.</p>\n<p>Why does this help?\nMCP tools are called fresh on demand.\nThe information then lands in the context. If it is lost through summarization, it can be retrieved again at any time.\nAdditionally, the Angular team maintains the responses and updates them regularly, so the problem of outdated knowledge is also addressed.\nAngular&#39;s MCP server provides various tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tools-overview\">Tools Overview</h3>\n<p><strong>Standard Tools:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>get_best_practices</code>: provides coding guidelines for modern Angular development.</li>\n<li><code>search_documentation</code>: searches the official Angular documentation version-specifically based on keywords.</li>\n<li><code>find_examples</code>: provides code examples for modern Angular features from a curated database.</li>\n<li><code>ai_tutor</code>: starts an interactive Angular course that guides you step by step through the framework.</li>\n<li><code>list_projects</code>: identifies applications and libraries in the workspace.</li>\n<li><code>onpush_zoneless_migration</code>: analyzes code and provides instructions for migrating to OnPush change detection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Experimental Tools:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>modernize</code>: supports migrations to modern patterns, e.g. Signal Inputs (<code>@Input</code> &rarr; <code>input()</code>), modern Outputs (<code>@Output</code> &rarr; <code>output()</code>), the <code>inject()</code> function, Signal Queries (<code>ViewChild</code>/<code>ContentChild</code> &rarr; Signals), Built-in Control Flow (<code>*ngIf</code>/<code>*ngFor</code> &rarr; <code>@if</code>/<code>@for</code>) and Self-Closing Tags.</li>\n<li><code>build</code>: performs a one-time build with <code>ng build</code>.</li>\n<li><code>devserver.start</code>, <code>devserver.stop</code>, <code>devserver.wait_for_build</code>: manage the Development Server.</li>\n<li><code>e2e</code>: runs End-to-End tests.</li>\n<li><code>test</code>: runs Unit tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the Angular team has a strong focus on AI, more tools will likely be added regularly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setting-up-the-mcp-server\">Setting up the MCP Server</h3>\n<p>For the AI agent to use the MCP server, we need to configure it once.\nThe command <code>ng mcp</code> displays a generic configuration example for this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ ng mcp\n\nTo start <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">using</span> the Angular CLI MCP Server, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">add</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>\nconfiguration to your host:\n\n{\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcpServers&quot;</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;angular-cli&quot;</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;command&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;npx&quot;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;args&quot;</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-y&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;@angular/cli&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcp&quot;</span>]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nExact configuration may differ depending <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">on</span> the host.\n\nFor more information <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> documentation, visit:\nhttps:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//angular.dev/ai/mcp</span>\n</code></pre><p>The <code>-y</code> flag in the <code>npx</code> command installs the Angular CLI without prompting if it is not present.\nThe <code>ng mcp</code> command only outputs setup guidance in the terminal.\nThe exact configuration differs depending on the agent. Typical configuration files are <code>mcp.json</code> or <code>settings.json</code>.\nThe <a href=\"https://angular.dev/ai\">Angular documentation</a> contains instructions for various agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabling-experimental-tools\">Enabling Experimental Tools</h3>\n<p>The experimental tools are disabled by default.\nTo use them, they must be explicitly enabled with the <code>--experimental-tool</code> flag (short: <code>-E</code>).\nThe standard tools remain available – the experimental tools are added, not replaced.</p>\n<p>Enable individual tools:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcpServers&quot;</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;angular-cli&quot;</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;command&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;npx&quot;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;args&quot;</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-y&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;<span class=\"hljs-variable\">@angular</span>/cli&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcp&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-E&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;modernize&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-E&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;test&quot;</span>]\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Enable all experimental tools at once:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcpServers&quot;</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;angular-cli&quot;</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;command&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;npx&quot;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;args&quot;</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-y&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;<span class=\"hljs-variable\">@angular</span>/cli&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;mcp&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-E&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;all&quot;</span>]\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>There is also the <code>devserver</code> group, which only enables the devserver tools (<code>devserver.start</code>, <code>devserver.stop</code>, <code>devserver.wait_for_build</code>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, two more options are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--read-only</code>: enables only read-only tools that don&#39;t modify files.</li>\n<li><code>--local-only</code>: enables only tools that don&#39;t require internet access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the MCP server is configured, the AI agent decides autonomously when to call which tool.\nThe MCP server does not run permanently, but is only started on demand and then stopped again.\nMost tools are read-only: They provide information like documentation, examples or best practices without modifying files.\nSome tools like <code>modernize</code> can, however, also call Angular CLI generators and thus modify code in the project.\nIf you want to use a specific tool, explicitly ask the agent for it, e.g. with <em>&quot;Use the <code>search_documentation</code> tool to search for Signal Forms&quot;</em>.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re curious, you can explore the Angular CLI&#39;s MCP server yourself.\nWith the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector\">MCP Inspector</a> tool, you can view and test all available tools in the web browser:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">npx</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">@modelcontextprotocol</span>/inspector <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;npx&quot;</span> --args <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;-y <span class=\"hljs-variable\">@angular</span>/cli mcp&quot;</span>\n</code></pre><p><figure><img src=\"%%MARKDOWN_BASE_URL%%/blog/2026-02-agentic-coding/mcp-inspector.png\" alt=\"The MCP Inspector in the browser shows the available tools of the Angular CLI MCP server.

})</code> or <code>toBeGreaterThan(0)</code> instead of <code>toBe(42)</code>.\nPay special attention to ensure the AI doesn&#39;t simply adjust the test when tests fail, instead of solving the actual problem.\nTherefore, always review generated code critically and demand strict typing.</li>\n<li><strong>Use recipes:</strong> Countless implementation patterns from the training data are stored in the LLM.\nDescribe what you need and have solution suggestions generated.\nAlways ask for possible alternatives too, and have pros and cons listed.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate migrations:</strong> For Angular upgrades or migration to new patterns like Standalone Components, Signals or Control Flow, the agent can take over a lot of work.\nThe MCP server provides dedicated tools for this.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair Programming:</strong> Use the agent as a &quot;sparring partner&quot; for architectural decisions.\nHave different solution paths shown to you.\nThe agent has no ego and explains patiently.</li>\n<li><strong>Use CLIs instead of Web:</strong> AI agents are increasingly receiving access blocks because they crawl websites intensively.\nTherefore use designated interfaces: for GitHub the GitHub CLI (<code>gh</code>), for Azure DevOps the Azure CLI (<code>az devops</code>) or provided MCP servers.\nCommand-line tools offer a more direct interface than web interfaces and consume less API quota, which saves costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional MCP servers:</strong> Connect additional MCP servers to your agent.\nMany tools from everyday development offer suitable integrations.\nBy connecting to your design software, ticket systems and other platforms, the agent can directly access documentation, designs and tickets and incorporate this information into its work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>AI agents are powerful tools that support us in developing with Angular.\nWith configuration files and the Angular CLI&#39;s MCP server, you bridge the gap between outdated training data and current best practices.\nBut AI does not replace expertise.\nThose who don&#39;t understand Angular&#39;s concepts cannot judge whether the generated code is correct.\nTherefore: Use AI as an accelerator, but invest in your own understanding – for example in <a href=\"https://angular.schule\">our Angular workshops</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n<p><small><strong>Header image:</strong> generated with Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3)</small></p>\n","meta":{"title":"Agentic Coding: AI Support for Angular","author":"Angular-Buch Team","mail":"team@angular-buch.com","bio":"<a href=\"https://angular-buch.com\"><img src=\"https://angular-buch.com/assets/img/book-cover-v1m.png\" alt=\"Angular-Buch Cover\" style=\"float: right;
