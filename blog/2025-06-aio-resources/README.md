**The old list of valuable resources from angular.io is gone, here you can find a mirror.**

<hr>

# What happened to the Angular Resources?

With the move from the old `angular.io` website to the new site at [angular.dev](https://angular.dev), not everything made the jump.
One particular gem that's now missing: the official list of Angular resources.

Remember this one?

â†’ [The Angular Resources page on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20240509213230/https://angular.io/resources)

This page used to provide a fantastic overview of UI component libraries, data management tools, IDEs, and other helpful Angular tooling.
But soon after the release of Angular 18, this curated list of Angular resources was completely gone.
[This is the last version](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/18.0.3/aio/content/marketing/resources.json), before the complete folder was erased.

## What now? ðŸ¤·

If you're new to Angular and wondering, "Which UI library should I use?" or "What are my options for state management?", 
there's no longer an official source that guides you through the ecosystem.

So we thought: 
> _Let's preserve the last state of the angular.io/resources page, right here on our blog!_ ðŸ˜Ž

For now, we've decided to bring back only the "UI Components" and "Data Libraries" sections.
Those are the ones we've referenced most often in our own [Angular workshops](https://angular.schule/).
But referring to an archive.org link isn't cool!


## angular.io/resources Mirror

Without much more ado, here's the good old list for you!
(with some fixed links and descriptions)

### Data Libraries

* [**Akita** (deprecated, replaced by Elf)](https://github.com/salesforce/akita)  
  Akita is a state management pattern, built on top of RxJS, which takes the idea of multiple data stores from Flux and the immutable updates from Redux, along with the concept of streaming data, to create the Observable Data Store model.

* [**Angular Fire**](https://github.com/angular/angularfire)  
  The official library for Firebase and Angular

* [**Apollo**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/)  
  Apollo is a data stack for modern apps, built with GraphQL.

* [**ButterCMS**](https://buttercms.com/docs/api-client/angular)  
  ButterCMS is a headless CMS that lets you manage content using our dashboard and integrate it into your Angular Application.

* [**Elf**](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/)  
  A Reactive Store with Magical Powers

* [**Formly**](https://formly.dev)  
  Formly is a dynamic (JSON powered) form library, built on top of Angular Reactive Forms.

* [**Meteor**](https://github.com/urigo/angular-meteor)  
  Use Angular and Meteor to build full-stack JavaScript apps for Mobile and Desktop.

* [**ngrx**](https://ngrx.io/)  
  Reactive Extensions for Angular

* [**ngx-api-utils**](https://github.com/ngx-api-utils/ngx-api-utils)  
  ngx-api-utils is a lean library of utilities and helpers to quickly integrate any HTTP API (REST, Ajax, and any other) with Angular.

* [**NGXS**](https://www.ngxs.io/)  
  NGXS is a state management pattern + library for Angular. NGXS is modeled after the CQRS pattern popularly implemented in libraries like Redux and NgRx but reduces boilerplate by using modern TypeScript features such as classes and decorators.

* [**rx-angular**](https://rx-angular.io)  
  RxAngular is a reactive library that provides extensions for developing high performant and scalable applications. It addresses the issues of local state management, rendering performance, and reactive architecture.

* [**RxWeb**](https://www.rxweb.io)  
  An Open-Source Architecture for Web Applications in Angular & .Net Core
