**The old list of valuable resources from angular.io is gone. Here you can find a mirror.**

<hr>

# What happened to the Angular Resources?

With the move from the old `angular.io` website to the new site at [angular.dev](https://angular.dev), not everything made the jump.
One particular gem that's now missing: the official list of Angular resources.

Remember this one?

â†’ [The Angular Resources page on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20240509213230/https://angular.io/resources)

This page used to provide a fantastic overview of UI component libraries, data management tools, IDEs, and other helpful Angular tooling.
But soon after the release of Angular 18, this curated list of Angular resources was completely gone.
[This is the last version](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/18.0.3/aio/content/marketing/resources.json), before the complete folder was erased.

## What now? ðŸ¤·

With the official angular.io resources page gone, navigating the ecosystem just got trickier. 
New developers might wonder, "Which UI library should I use?" or "What are my options for state management?" 
This gap leaves everyone searching for reliable recommendations without an official starting point.

So we thought: 
> _Let's preserve the last state of the angular.io/resources page, right here on our blog!_ ðŸ˜Ž


## Angular Resources Mirror

For now, we've decided to bring back only the "UI Components" and "Data Libraries" sections.
Those are the ones we've referenced most often in our own [Angular workshops](https://angular.schule/).
But referring to an archive.org link isn't cool!

Without further ado, here's the good old list for you!
(We've restored the list and updated a few links for accuracy.)

### Data Libraries

* [**Akita** (deprecated, replaced by Elf)](https://github.com/salesforce/akita)
