We want to adopt this analogy and display the newest element at the top of the list before it runs to the bottom and eventually disappears.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://angular-schule.github.io/website-articles/2020-02-rxjs-train-windowloghistory.gif\" alt=\"Animated GIF of a demo application with a log history\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"a-look-into-the-documentation\">A look into the documentation</h2>\n<p>My first approach to tackling reactive problems is a quick look into the <a href=\"https://rxjs.dev/api\">RxJS API documentation</a>.\nIt&#39;s very likely that an operator exists for solving the problem.\nHowever, it&#39;s important to not let yourself confuse by the number of operators, especially those who sound suitable at first glance.\nFor a few minutes, I was obsessed with the thought that one of the <code>buffer</code> or <code>window</code> operators might be the solution.\nThey are not! Both <code>buffer</code> and <code>window</code> (and their relatives) collect values from the source and emit them all at once – after a time or when a signal appears.\nThis sounds good but is still not the right thing for us when we want to move a window forward.</p>\n<p>Finally, I cleared my mind and started all over again.\nIf there is no suitable operator for you, it&#39;s the best to think in fundamentals and begin from the ground up using low-level operators like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>scan</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-scan-operator\">About the scan operator</h2>\n<p>When you read about the <a href=\"https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/scan\"><code>scan</code> operator</a> you often stumble upon examples that add up values, like this one:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { scan } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> source$ = <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">of</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> result$ = source$.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">pipe</span>(\n  <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">scan</span>(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">acc, item</span>) =&gt;</span> acc + item, <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>)\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Result: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>It transforms the stream of numbers to a stream of intermediate results from the addition performed as <code>acc + item</code>.\nThe <code>scan</code> operator is also the functional basis for Redux-style state management where we reduce a stream of actions to state objects.\nBut let&#39;s take a closer look at the <code>scan</code> operator.</p>\n<p>The first argument to <code>scan</code> is a <em>reducer function</em> with two arguments itself: <code>acc</code> and <code>item</code>.\nThe argument <code>item</code> is the emitted item from the source stream.\nWhatever we return from the function will be the next item in the stream that flows <em>out</em> of the operator.\nIn a way, <code>scan</code> is similar to <code>map</code> here.\nThe key difference however is that the reducer also gets the result from its last emission as an argument (also called <em>accumulator</em>, hence the argument name <code>acc</code>).</p>\n<p>So whenever the source fires, we get the following arguments to the reducer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the new source item (<code>item</code>)</li>\n<li>the previously calculated result (<code>acc</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On first execution, <code>acc</code> will be undefined since there is no previous calculation.\nThis is why we can provide a <em>seed</em> value as the secound argument to <code>scan</code> which will be used as first value to <code>acc</code> then.</p>\n<p>The following code listing shows the general structure of how we use <code>scan</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">reducer</span>(acc, item) {\n  // calculate next value\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-type\">nextValue</span>;\n}\n\nscan(reducer, seed);\n</code></pre>\n<p>How does all this help us with the train window now?</p>\n<h2 id=\"scanning-train-windows\">Scanning train windows</h2>\n<p>Back to our train window problem: We want to produce a stream of arrays where each contains the last <code>n</code> items from the source.\nThis array is the list we render in the UI to display the items.</p>\n<p>When the source stream looks like this (one item per line)...</p>\n<pre><code>😍\n🦊\n🍓\n🐈\n🍕\n🐙\n⚽️\n🐳\n</code></pre>\n<p>...and <code>n</code> is 4, the result should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-string\">[😍]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🦊, 😍]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🍓, 🦊, 😍]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🐈, 🍓, 🦊, 😍]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🍕, 🐈, 🍓, 🦊]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🐙, 🍕, 🐈, 🍓]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[⚽️, 🐙, 🍕, 🐈]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">[🐳, ⚽️, 🐙, 🍕]</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#39;s go ahead and scan over the source stream.\nThis means, as an output we want to create an array that contains</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the new source item at the beginning</li>\n<li>the first <code>n - 1</code> items from the last result array</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> n = <span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> result$ = source$.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">pipe</span>(\n  <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">scan</span>(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">acc, item</span>) =&gt;</span> [item, ...acc.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">slice</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, n - <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>)], [])\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need to provide an empty array as seed here so that the array operation <code>.slice()</code> does not fail for an undefined value.</p>\n<p>So what can we achieve with this pattern? There are many possible practical cases: displaying the latest logging entries, the latest stock prices or just the latest tweets about a topic like <code>#Angular</code>.\nThink of a stream of events that you want to display in realtime, but truncated: then this example is for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extra-build-a-custom-operator\">Extra: Build a custom operator</h2>\n<p>To hide the complexity we can wrap this thing into a custom operator.\nI wrote a dedicated blog post about this topic here: <a href=\"https://angular.schule/blog/2018-02-rxjs-own-log-operator\">Build your own RxJS logging operator</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">shiftWindow</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">n: number = <span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span></span>) {\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> scan(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">acc, item</span>) =&gt;</span> [item, ...acc.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">slice</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, n - <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>)], []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ts\">const result<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$ </span>= source<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$.</span>pipe(\n  shiftWindow(<span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>)\n);\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"demo\">Demo</h2>\n<p>You can find a working demo on Stackblitz:</p>\n<iframe style=\"width:100%; height: 25em\" title=\"Stackblitz-Demo\" src=\"https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-train-window?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts\"></iframe>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niklas_wortmann\">Jan-Niklas Wortmann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohannesHoppe\">Johannes Hoppe</a> for review and feedback.</p>\n<p><small><strong>Header image:</strong> Photo by &quot;Free-Photos&quot; on <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/de/photos/zug-wagen-fenster-eisenbahn-569323/\">Pixabay</a>, modified.
